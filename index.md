# Self Introduction
### *By Kabir Vats*
## Who am I as a UCSD student?

I would consider myself very involved with my University. I'm a officer for HKN (Eta Kappa Nu), a member of UAS (United Accounting Society) and I am Sixth College's Senator for UCSD's Student Government. I've prioritized extracurricular involvements because I wanted to set myself apart by developign and demonstrating soft skills through my extracurrulars while still developing outstanding technical skills. I'm excited to be taking CSE 110 with Dr. Powell because, as Dr. Powell himself said,
> this course will help students build a foundation of thinking skills, theoretical knowledge, practical application, and exposure to practical industry-tested experience
