# Self Introduction

## Who am I as a UCSD student?

I would consider myself very involved with my University. I'm a officer for HKN (Eta Kappa Nu), a member of UAS (United Accounting Society) and I am Sixth College's Senator for UCSD's Student Government. I've prioritized extracurricular involvements because I wanted to set myself apart by developign and demonstrating soft skills through my extracurrulars while still developing outstanding technical skills. I'm excited to be taking CSE 110 with Dr. Powell because, as Dr. Powell himself says in the syllabus,
> this course will help students build a foundation of thinking skills, theoretical knowledge, practical application, and exposure to practical industry-tested experience.
I'm excited to get a new perspective on software engineering in the "real world."

### Who am I as a programmer?

I definitely would not consider myself an expert programmer, but I put my best effort into practicing fundamentals. I have two projects I've worked on that are available on my github. Here are the links:

* [To-Do List](https://github.com/kabir-vats/flow-control)
* Time Tracker Web App
  * [Front End](https://github.com/kabir-vats/TimeTrackerReact)
  * [Back End](https://github.com/kabir-vats/TimeTrackerAPI)

As you can probably see, I did not do a great job with documentation and the project workflow. There is tons of room for improvement there, and I'm hoping to work on that through this course!
