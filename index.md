## Who am I as a UCSD student?

I would consider myself very involved with my University. I'm a officer for HKN (Eta Kappa Nu), a member of UAS (United Accounting Society) and I am Sixth College's Senator for UCSD's Student Government. I've prioritized extracurricular involvements because I wanted to set myself apart by developing and demonstrating soft skills through my extracurrulars while still developing outstanding technical skills. I'm excited to be taking CSE 110 with Dr. Powell because, as Dr. Powell himself says in the syllabus,
> this course will help students build a foundation of thinking skills, theoretical knowledge, practical application, and exposure to practical industry-tested experience.
I'm excited to get a new perspective on software engineering in the "real world."

## Who am I as a programmer?

I definitely would not consider myself an expert programmer, but I put my best effort into practicing fundamentals. I have two projects I've worked on that are available on my github. Here are the links:

* [To-Do List](https://github.com/kabir-vats/flow-control)
* Time Tracker Web App
  * [Front End](https://github.com/kabir-vats/TimeTrackerReact)
  * [Back End](https://github.com/kabir-vats/TimeTrackerAPI)

As you can probably see, I did not do a great job with documentation and the project workflow. There is tons of room for improvement there, and I'm hoping to work on that through this course!

If you are curious about my favorite programming language, you can find it in [This File](./README.md)

## Who am I as a person?

I always say, my greatest skill is being a good **listener**. I love learning, and luckily being a good listener gets me a lot of learning! Here are some other things I want to get a working understanding of in the next quarter. If I remember, I'll check things off of this list as I learn them over time.

- [ ] Personal Finance (To Create a Saving Plan)
- [ ] Mandarin Chinese
- [ ] Software Engineering (This class!)
- [ ] Programming in Python
- [ ] Social habits for effective leadership

It's a small list, but these are the things I'm really hoping to dive into in the next 10 weeks.
